                     The Persian Wars, fought between a coalition of 
					 Greek cities and the vast Achaemenid Persian Empire was 
					 a pivotal moment in Greek politics. After having successfully prevented the annexation 
					 of Greece by the Persians, Sparta, the dominant power in the coalition, had no intention of further 
					 offensive action and considered the war over. Meanwhile, Athens counter-attacked.

				 <p class="paragraph">Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in 
				 the Muromachi period (1336â€“1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation.
				 In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, 
				 causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka,
